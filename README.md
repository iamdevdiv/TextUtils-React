# TextUtils 🔤

TextUtils is a React-based web application that provides quick text manipulation utilities like converting text to uppercase, lowercase, inverting case, alternating case, and more — along with a live word/character count and reading time estimate.

> ✨ This was my **first React project**, built while following [CodeWithHarry’s React JS Tutorial Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agx66oZnT6IyhcMIbUMNMdt). I also explored and integrated [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/) components myself.

## ✨ Features

* ✅ Convert to UPPERCASE / lowercase
* 🔄 Invert Case (e.g., `HeLLo` → `hEllO`)
* 🎲 Alternate Case (e.g., `hello` → `hElLo`)
* 🧼 Clear text
* 📋 Copy to clipboard
* 🧮 Live word and character count
* ⏱️ Estimated reading time
* 📑 Preview section
* ❓ FAQ page using Flowbite’s accordion
